# tez: Train PyTorch Models Fasterrrr.....

tez (तेज़ / تیز) means sharp, fast & active. This is a simple, to-the-point, library to make your pytorch training easy.

Note: This library is in very early-stage currently! So, there might be breaking changes.

Idea around tez is simple:

- keep things as simple as possible
- make it as customizable as possible
- clean code
- faster prototyping
- production ready

Currently, tez supports cpu and gpu training. More coming soon!
